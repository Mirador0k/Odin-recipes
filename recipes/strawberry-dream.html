    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups quartered fresh strawberries</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons of white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 cupts heavy cream</li>   
        <li>¼ teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>¼ cup freshly squeezed lemon juice</li>
        <li>⅔ cup diced fresh strawberries</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare strawberry puree: Mix quartered strawberries and sugar in a 2-cup liquid measure or bowl. Let sit and macerate for 1 hour, stirring every 10 to 15 minutes. Use an immersion blender to blend into a smooth puree. Pass through a mesh strainer to remove seeds, if desired. Cover and refrigerate until needed.</li>
        <li>Prepare cream mixture: Combine sugar and cream in a saucepan. Set heat to medium-high and bring to a boil while whisking occasionally; be careful, since cream can easily boil over. Once cream just starts to boil, reduce heat to between medium and medium-low and maintain a steady simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and whisk in vanilla, lemon juice, and 1/3 cup of the reserved strawberry puree until completely incorporated. Let cool for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>While the cream is cooling, pour the remaining strawberry puree evenly into 4 dessert glasses.</li>
        <li>Pour the cooled cream mixture into the glasses. Wrap with plastic wrap and pop in the refrigerator until thoroughly chilled, 3 to 4 hours.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare topping: Toss diced strawberries and sugar together in a small bowl. Wrap with plastic wrap and chill alongside the strawberry dreams.</li>
        <li>When ready to serve, remove strawberry dreams and topping from the refrigerator. Stir the topping and spoon strawberries and any accumulated juices on top of each dream.</li>
    </ol>
